**This release does not support magnet links (only *.torrent file)**

**Known bugs (fix in future releases)**

- Due to sleep mode, torrent downloads can pause on their own (you have to manually pause and restart).
*This bug will be fixed after: I teach the app to detect the approximate download time. Then, the program will be able to restart the download on its own.*
- If your device does not have enough space, then the torrent is added, but it gives an error [Errno 28] No space left on device
*In the future, I will teach the program to determine the size of the loaded content and not add it if there is not enough space.*
*I also plan to add a selective file download mode if a torrent with many files is being downloaded.*
